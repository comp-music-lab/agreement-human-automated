Code/data for "AGREEMENT AMONG HUMAN AND AUTOMATED TRANSCRIPTIONS OF GLOBAL SONGS"

Ozaki,Y.,McBride,J.,Benetos,E.,Pfordresher,P.,Six,J.,Tierney,A.T.,Proutskova, P., Sakai, E., Kondo, H., Fukatsu, H., Fujii, S., & Savage, P. E. (2021). Agreement among human and automated transcriptions of global songs. PsyArxiv preprint. https://psyarxiv.com/jsa4u, and previous anonymized OpenReview preprint. https://openreview.net/forum?id=WL_MC7HgGQ

The audio files can be found from the zenodo link above. Note sequence files are presented under the "Note sequences" folder, and the transcriptions by human transcribers using MuseScore3 are presented under the "Transcriptions" folder. 

The "Scripts" folder contains R and MATLAB codes for the study. R codes are mainly used to create sequence alignment and the creation of the figures. It also contains hypothesis testing scripts for human-human agreement evaluation and the false discovery rate control for simultaneous inference. MATLAB codes are used to create note sequences from audio files and to perform hypothesis testing of human-machine agreement evaluation.
